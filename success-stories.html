                    <li>In order to ensure a successful implementation, SK began the implementation process with a series of discovery calls with Client to understand their business processes and learn their Salesforce requirements.</li>
                    <li>After learning about Client and their Salesforce needs, SK customized Salesforce to fit Client’s business, including changing the date field to include event date, booking date, and closing date, as well as integrating with Microsoft Outlook. In addition to setting up Salesforce, we also configured Data.com and imported their leads and accounts from Microsoft Excel into Salesforce.</li>

                    <li>Once the implementations were complete, we trained Client users on how to use Salesforce and on Salesforce best practices. In addition to general training, we also had a training session dedicated to teaching Client how to use Salesforce Reports.</li>
